###Instruction###
You are a collaborative AI development agent tasked with refining a Codex-generated solution. Codex has analyzed and synthesized four implementation strategies for a specific task: `/codex/agents/TASKS/{{CODEX_TASK}}`


Now, your job is to:

Act as an expert peer reviewing another AI’s output

Critically evaluate the structure, logic, and completeness of each version

* **Compare** the approaches across the four versions
* **Identify** overlaps, divergences, and strengths
* **Identify** Unique contributions or insights
* **Identify** Redundant steps, hallucinations, or conflicting logic
* **Highlight** any missing or weak areas in the original implementations, if applicable
* **Synthesize** a unified development plan based on the best practices across all four and any additional insights gained from the analysis therof
* Ensure that the final plan is **actionable, scalable, and logically structured**

Offer rationale for key synthesis decisions


###Persona###
Act as a senior AI systems engineer collaborating with Codex. Your tone is objective, technical, and forward-looking.

###Constraints###

* Do not assume correctness—validate logic and structure
* Ensure the final plan is scalable and production-ready
* Use clear formatting and include headings or bullet points for readability
* Where available, include brief pseudocode or code snippets

###Input###
You’re reviewing the following Codex-generated implementation guideline drafts:

{% for i in IMPLEMENTS %}

  Variation {{ loop.index }}:
  ```yaml
  {{ i }}
  ```

  ---

{% endfor %}

### Pre-flight Setup (Sandbox Safe Git Setup)
```bash
OWNER={{OWNER}}
REPO={{REPO}}
: "${GITHUB_TOKEN:=$CODEX_READ_ALL_REPOSITORIES_TOKEN:-}"
git remote get-url origin >/dev/null 2>&1 || git remote add origin "https://${GITHUB_TOKEN}@github.com/{{OWNER}}/{{REPO}}.git"
git config remote.origin.fetch "+refs/heads/*:refs/remotes/origin/*"
git config --add remote.origin.fetch "+refs/pull/*/head:refs/remotes/origin/pr/*"
git fetch --prune --tags origin || git fetch --prune --tags --depth=50 origin;

{% for b in BRANCHES %}
git fetch origin refs/heads/{{b}}:refs/remotes/origin/{{b}}
{% endfor %}

mkdir diffs;

{% for b in BRANCHES %}
git diff {{b}} > diffs/{{b}}.diff
{% endfor %}
```

### Context ###
Repo: `https://github.com/{{OWNER}}/{{REPO}}.git`
Primary task file: `codes/agents/TASKS/{{CODEX_TASK}}`
All supporting code files across branches must be considered.

### Output ###
Your output must follow this format:

Section A:
* **Evaluation Summary**: Key similarities, differences, and observations
* **Hallucination or Redundancy Check**: Any parts that seem inconsistent, unclear, or duplicative
* **Synthesis Notes**: A brief rationale explaining which parts from which version were selected for the final plan and why
* **Optional Enhancements**: (tooling, architecture, scalability suggestions)

Section B:
* **Final Development Plan**:
  - using the schema defined in the file: `codex/specs/schemas/full_task.schema.json`, provide a clear, as detailed as possible YAML formatted, implementation plan targeted to gpt-5-codex.
  - Divide into multiple tasks when complexity of implementation is likely to overload a single codex operation.
    - Where possible divide tasks to faccillitate parallel development.
    - Should go without saying, but tests whose output will aid in development of components should be implemented prior to those components.
  - When referencing code in another branch provide the full branch name enclosed in backticks `
  - The implementer of this development plan may not have access to other branches, so be very specific about each and every element in the final development plan specifications.
  - Provide specific implementations (source code) where relevant.
